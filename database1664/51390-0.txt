                          SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT
                                 OF THE
                          BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY.


                       BY J. W. POWELL, DIRECTOR.




                             INTRODUCTION.


The prosecution of research among the North American Indians, as
directed by act of Congress, was continued during the fiscal year
1884-'85.

No change has been made in the general plan upon which the work has been
prosecuted as set forth in former reports. Certain lines of
investigation have been decided upon, which are confided to persons
trained in their pursuit, and the results of these labors are presented
from time to time in the publications of the Bureau provided for by law.
A brief statement of the work upon which each of the special students
was actively engaged during the fiscal year is furnished below; this,
however, does not embrace all the studies undertaken or services
rendered by them, since particular lines of research have been suspended
in this, as in former years, in order to prosecute temporarily work
regarded as of paramount importance. From this cause delays have been
occasioned in the completion of several treatises and monograph's,
already partly in type, which otherwise would have been published.

Invitation is renewed for the assistance of explorers, writers, and
students who are not and may not desire to be officially connected with
the Bureau. Their contributions, whether in the shape of suggestions or
of extended communications, will be gratefully acknowledged, and, if
published either in the series of reports or in monographs or bulletins,
as the liberality of Congress may in future allow, will always receive
proper credit.

The items now reported upon are presented in three principal divisions.
The first relates to the publication made; the second, to the work
prosecuted in the field; and the third, to the office work, which
largely consists of the preparation for publication of the results of
field work, with the corrections and additions obtained from the
literature of the subjects and by correspondence.




                              PUBLICATION.


The only publication actually issued during the year was entitled
Proof-Sheets of a Bibliography of the Languages of the North American
Indians, by James Constantine Pilling. The volume, a quarto of 1,175
pages, consists of an author catalogue of books, manuscripts, magazine
and newspaper articles, publications of learned societies, and other
documents relating in any way to the Indian languages of North America.
Only one hundred copies were printed, which were distributed to
collaborators.

This work was commenced by Mr. Pilling in 1879 and has been prosecuted
with diligence and skill, notwithstanding the engrossing nature of his
other duties. It began as an author card catalogue, designed merely for
office use. In time it became apparent that such a systematic catalogue
of the literature of Indian languages, if printed and distributed, would
be of important service to all the numerous workers on the general
subject, besides those directly connected with the Bureau, to whom alone
it was accessible in manuscript form. By this course the accumulated
results of several years' labor would be immediately available for the
use of students generally, and the distribution of proof-sheets would in
turn increase interest in the work, elicit comment and criticism, and
secure additional contributions, through all of which the final volume
contemplated would become more satisfactory and complete, both in form
and substance. The thorough conscientiousness and punctilious care shown
in the present catalogue, and especially the comprehensive bibliographic
spirit in which the work has been conceived, prove the peculiar fitness
of the author for the undertaking. He has set before him and has kept
steadily in view the following aims:

First, to discover every document in existence relating to the subject,
either printed or in manuscript.

Secondly, to record a description of every document found, so accurate
and full that each book or article mentioned is clearly identified and
all its contents relating to Indian languages set forth, with citation
of the chapters and pages within the work where the linguistic material
may be found.

Thirdly, to name, when possible, one or more libraries where each work
catalogued may be found.

Fourthly, to arrange and combine the whole so that the student using it
may in the shortest time learn whether any work contains the special
matter which he desires to consult, and, if so, precisely where he may
find it. In the case of rare books or papers special attention has been
paid to obtain full information, and in the case of some of the rarest
books fac-similes of the title pages are given. The value of a work so
broadly conceived and so carefully executed is very great. The
literature of this subject has become so voluminous, so disconnected, so
scattered in time and place, that progress in the classification of
Indian languages and the determination of their affinities has been
greatly retarded, awaiting the orderly arrangement of accumulated
information. This requisite, with the important addition of the
correction of current errors, is met by the catalogue. It has been found
indispensable to the Bureau and has already been gratefully acknowledged
as invaluable by all students of American tribes to whom copies have
been distributed.

Since the printing and distribution of the proof-sheets, and markedly as
a result thereof, the card catalogue has continued to grow; and,
although not complete and, from the nature of the subject, not expected
to become absolutely exhaustive, the recent additions to it indicate how
thoroughly the work was originally done. It may be possible, therefore,
before long to substitute for the Proof-Sheets the Bibliography itself
in standard form.




                              FIELD WORK.


Under this heading are comprised—

First, the systematic operations of the division of mound exploration
carried on east of the Rocky Mountains.

Secondly, researches in and collections from the ancient ruins of the
Southwest and comparative study of the present inhabitants of that
region and the objects found among them.

Thirdly, linguistic work or expeditions among the several Indian tribes
at their homes, with the main purpose of acquiring knowledge of their
spoken languages.

Fourthly, general studies, or those embracing various branches of
inquiry, conducted among the existing Indian tribes.


                          MOUND EXPLORATIONS.


                      WORK OF PROF. CYRUS THOMAS.

The work of exploring the mounds and other ancient monuments of that
portion of the United States east of the Rocky Mountains, commenced in
1882, was carried on during the fiscal year, under the charge of Prof.
Cyrus Thomas.

The regular assistants during the first half of the year were Messrs.
P.W. Norris, James D. Middleton, and John P. Rogan. For the latter half
they were Messrs. Middleton, Rogan, and John W. Emmert, the last named
having been engaged to fill the vacancy occasioned by the death of Mr.
Norris.

Mr. Norris was engaged during the fall of 1884 in exploring the
extensive group of works in the vicinity of Charleston, Kanawha Valley,
W. Va. He continued at work there until December, when he was compelled
by cold weather and illness to desist. To the great regret of all his
associates in the work, his illness terminated in death on the 14th of
January, 1885. By his death the division has lost a faithful and
enthusiastic worker.

During the summer and fall of 1884 and until the approach of extremely
cold weather, Mr. Middleton was engaged in exploring the works of Knox
County, Ohio. Throughout the winter and following spring his field of
operations was eastern Arkansas. In the latter field he was assisted by
Mr. L. H. Thing, who was employed for three months as temporary
assistant.

During the summer and until the beginning of winter, Mr. Rogan was
engaged (in conjunction with Rev. J. P. Maclean, who was employed as a
temporary assistant) in exploring the ancient monuments of Butler County
and the adjacent regions of southern Ohio. On the approach of the cold
season he went south, his field of operations for the remainder of the
year being northern Georgia and the southern counties of East Tennessee.

Mr. Emmert, who had been employed on January 1, 1885, to make some
special explorations in East Tennessee, was made permanent assistant
immediately after the death of Mr. Norris. His work in that section
proving successful he continued it until the close of the fiscal year.

Mr. Gerard Fowke was engaged during November in examining the ancient
quarries of Flint Ridge, Ohio, and in making a collection to illustrate
the various stages in the aboriginal manufacture of flint implements.
His collection is, perhaps, the most complete in this particular line of
any so far made in this country. In the winter he was employed about two
months in special investigations of some ancient works in Pontotoc and
Union Counties, Miss., a locality supposed to have been visited by De
Soto during his unfortunate expedition. In some of the mounds of this
section, which was formerly the home of the Chikasa, he found some
articles of European manufacture, among them a small silver plate
bearing the royal arms of Castile and Leon in an old heraldic form.

Although the number of specimens obtained does not exceed that of the
collection of the preceding year, the general result shows a decided
advance in the accuracy of the work done. The measurements and plats
have been made with more care and exactness, the descriptions are more
complete, and the details more fully set forth. As an illustration one
case is presented. A large mound was opened which was found to contain
over ninety skeletons, irregularly placed and at different depths. At
the outset a plat of the mound was made; each skeleton was located on it
as discovered, and notes were taken of the depth, position, articles
found with it, etc. Thus the exact position of each skeleton in the
mound is recorded, as well as that of any article accompanying it. The
collections made are more varied in character than those of any previous
year, including several new types of pottery, some unusually fine stone
implements, and from several mounds articles showing contact with
Europeans. The pottery obtained by Messrs. Middleton and Thing in
Arkansas is of more than ordinary interest, containing a number of
specimens of the rarer forms, also several colored specimens.

The same care has been taken as heretofore in labeling and numbering the
specimens, so that each can be traced by the record to the exact place
where it was found. The illustrations showing the construction,
character, and form of the various works explored exceed in number,
accuracy, and importance those of any previous year.


                     EXPLORATIONS IN THE SOUTHWEST.


                      WORK OF MR. JAMES STEVENSON.

Mr. James Stevenson was placed in charge of a party, with instructions
to proceed to Arizona and New Mexico to make researches and collections
among the Pueblo Indians and the ancient ruins in that region.

Mr. Stevenson's party was divided into three sections. The section in
charge of Mr. F. T. Bickford visited the remarkable series of ruins in
Chaco cañon, in northwestern New Mexico; Cañon de Chelly and its branch
cañons; the cliff dwellings in Walnut cañon, in Arizona, and a group of
interesting cave dwellings, different in structure from any heretofore
found, near Flagstaff, in the same Territory. All these were carefully
examined. Full and extensive notes, as well as sketches and photographic
illustrations, were made of these ruins.

Another section, in charge of Mr. C. A. Garlick, was stationed at the
pueblo of Acoma, in New Mexico. The work at this village resulted in a
collection of about thirty-five hundred specimens, consisting of pottery
and a variety of utensils of other material, such as stone, bone, wood,
and woven fabrics, illustrating the arts of the people of Acoma. The
collections from this pueblo, though not embracing a great variety of
objects, will illustrate nearly all the phases of the arts and
industrial pursuits of these Indians.

Another section of Mr. Stevenson's party, under his own supervision and
with the important assistance of Mrs. Stevenson, was employed in making
collections and studies at Zuñi. The collection from there is much
larger than any heretofore obtained and includes many objects relating
to the outdoor ceremonies of the Zuñi. Specimens of these were secured
from their sacred springs, caves, and shrines. All details relating to
their ceremonials were attentively studied, and a series of water color
sketches was made of altars used and of masks worn on these important
occasions. A large number of fetiches was also obtained, representing
many of the animals held in religious esteem by the Zuñi. A series of
photographs was made of the sacred springs, wells, monuments, picture
writings, and shrines of the Zuñi located at different points over an
area of about seventy-five miles from Zuñi, and a collection was secured
of representative specimens of their fetiches, plume sticks, and other
objects connected with their mythology and religious practices. The
collection made during the year was unusually large and important. It
comprises about eighty-five hundred specimens from the Indian tribes of
the Southwest embraced in the research; these consist of woven fabrics
and pottery, bone, and stone implements, both ancient and modern, and
represent nearly all phases of the life, art, and industries of these
tribes. These collections have been deposited in the U. S. National
Museum for arrangement, classification, and description.


                     WORK OF MR. VICTOR MINDELEFF.

A party in charge of Mr. Victor Mindeleff left Washington on August 5 to
survey the ruined pueblos of the Chaco, in New Mexico. Five of the ruins
were accurately measured and platted to scale, and a full series of
sketches, plans, and photographs was secured. Mr. Mindeleff returned
from the field on the 1st of October. He then made a trip to the great
Etowah mound, near Cartersville, Ga., under the direction of Prof. Cyrus
Thomas, in order to secure an accurate survey and scale drawing, as a
basis for the construction of a model.

At the close of this work Mr. Mindeleff returned to Washington, on
October 7, and was engaged in office work until the middle of the
following June, when he took the field in advance of his party for
further studies among the ruins and pueblos of the Cibola and Tusayan
groups. He was also instructed to secure similar material at other
available points for comparison.


                         LINGUISTIC FIELD WORK.


                    WORK OF MRS. ERMINNIE A. SMITH.

From the 1st of July to the 15th of August, 1884, Mrs. Smith, assisted
by Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt, of Tuscarora descent, was engaged among the
Onondaga living near Syracuse, N. Y., in translating and annotating two
Onondaga manuscripts; afterward, until the latter part of October, with
the same assistance, she was at work on the Grand River reservation in
Canada, where she filled out the vocabulary in the Introduction to the
Study of Indian Languages from the dialect of the Cayuga. She also
obtained from the Mohawk a translation, with annotations, of a
manuscript in their dialect.

The three manuscripts mentioned are now in the possession of the Bureau
of Ethnology. Their origin and history are not distinctly known, as they
are all probably copies of originals which seem to have been lost or
destroyed. It was intended in these manuscripts to reproduce, by the
alphabet and the script used by English writers, the sound of the
dialects employed.

These records have their chief interest in the preservation of many
archaic words, or those of ceremony, law, and custom, which in these
dialects, as is the general rule, remain unchanged, although the
colloquial language may be modified. The subject matter of all these
records is genuinely and exclusively Iroquoian.

The Mohawk manuscript was copied about the year 1830 by Chief John
"Smoke" Johnson from an earlier original or perhaps copy. The
orthography of this copy is quite regular and is that of the early
English missionaries, being similar in many respects to the well known
Pickering alphabet.

One of the Onondaga manuscripts was found in the possession of Mr.
Daniel La Fort and the other in that of Mrs. John A. Jones, both of the
Onondaga reserve, New York. These two copies differ from each other in
orthography and substance, the Jones manuscript being probably a full
detail of a part of the other.

The orthography of the La Fort manuscript is very irregular and
difficult to read, but that of the Jones manuscript is regular and
legible. The Mohawk manuscript contains a detailed account of the rites
and ceremonies, speeches and songs, of the condoling and inducting
council of the Iroquoian League in the form in which that council was
conducted by the elder brothers or members of the Onondaga, Mohawk, and
Seneca divisions, which have been generally called tribes, but are more
correctly confederacies, their villages being the tribal unit. The La
Fort Onondaga manuscript comprises a similar ritual of the same council
as carried out by the younger brothers, viz., the Cayuga, Oneida, and
Tuscarora members or confederacies of the league. The Jones Onondaga
manuscript is the charge of the principal shaman to the newly elected or
inducted chief or chiefs.

During the remainder of the year material was collected and work
continued on the Tuscarora-English part of the Tuscarora dictionary.


                       WORK OF MR. H. W. HENSHAW.

Mr. H. W. Henshaw visited southern California for the purpose of
pursuing linguistic studies in the group of languages spoken by the
Santa Barbara Indians. Although these Indians became known at a very
early day, being mentioned with particularity in the relation of
Cabrillo's voyage along the California coast in 1542, but little has
been ascertained in respect to their language and its relations to the
speech of neighboring tribes.

Few vocabularies were collected by the early Spanish missionaries and
those gathered were very imperfect, so that no conclusions can be based
upon them with confidence.

As a result of the policy pursued by the various missionaries among
these docile tribes, aboriginal habits were soon exchanged for others
imposed by the priests. Tribal organizations were broken up and the
Indians were removed from their homes and located about the missions. In
addition the Spanish language was early introduced and so far as
possible made to replace the aboriginal tongue. As a consequence Spanish
became familiar to a large number of the proselytes, and all the
surviving Santa Barbara Indians speak Spanish fluently, or rather the
Mexican dialect of Spanish. Indeed, the impression prevails generally in
California that none of the Indians can speak their own tongue. As a
matter of fact, however, in their own families and when away from the
white men they discard Spanish entirely.

The attempt to preserve the language was begun none too soon, as of the
large population attributed to this part of the California coast Mr.
Henshaw was able to discover only about fifty survivors, and these were
widely scattered over several counties. A number of the dialects of the
linguistic family are now extinct, and only a month before Mr. Henshaw's
arrival at San Buenaventura an old woman died who, it is believed, was
the last person to speak the dialect belonging to the Island of Santa
Cruz. In Santa Barbara and Ventura counties six dialects of the family
were found, which are believed to be all that are now extant.

In the case of the dialect of Santa Rosa island, but one Indian remained
to speak it. Two more dialects are spoken by two or three individuals
only. The existing dialects, named according to the missions around
which they were spoken, are as follows: San Buenaventura, Santa Barbara,
Santa Rosa Island, Purissima, Santa Inez, and San Luis Obispo. With the
exception of the last named the several dialects are very closely
related, and, although each possesses a greater or less number of words
not contained in the others, their vocabularies show many words which
are common to all.

The dialect formerly spoken at San Luis Obispo differs much from any of
the others, and a critical comparison is necessary to reveal a
sufficient number of words possessing identical roots to render their
common parentage obvious.

Extensive vocabularies of the dialects of San Antonio and San Miguel
were obtained, there being about a dozen Indians who speak these
languages around the old San Antonio mission. These languages have been
supposed to be of the Santa Barbara family (as it has hitherto been
termed, now called Chumashan family), but the material obtained by Mr.
Henshaw disproves this, and, for the present at least, they are
considered to form a distinct family.

Mr. Henshaw visited Los Angeles and San Diego counties for the purpose
of determining the exact northern and southern limits of the Shoshonian
family, which extends quite to the coast in California.

At San Diego and San Luis Rey he obtained vocabularies representing four
dialects of the Yuman family.


                      WORK OF MR. A. S. GATSCHET.

In August, 1884, Mr. Gatschet proceeded to visit the Tonkawē and Lipan
tribes in Texas.

He reached Fort Griffin on the 29th of August. The Tonkawē tribe was
encamped about a mile and a half south of Fort Griffin, Shackleford
county, and consisted of 78 individuals, while the Lipan camp, one mile
north-northwest, consisted of 19 persons only. All these Indians were on
the point of removing to the Oakland reserve, Indian Territory.

The Tonkawē constitute an aggregate of several tribal remnants formerly
living independently of one another in southern Texas and on the Rio
Grande. Mr. Gatschet devoted five weeks to the study of their language
and one week to that of the Lipan, which is a dialect of Apache
(Athapascan). The Tonkawē is a sonorous and energetic form of speech.
The radix of many of the adjectives becomes reduplicated to form a kind
of plural, and the same thing is observed in some of the verbs, where
iteration or frequency has to be indicated. Case suffixes are observed
in the substantive, which can easily be traced to postpositions as their
original forms. Very few of the natives were sufficiently conversant
with English or Spanish to serve as interpreters, so that it was
difficult to secure trustworthy results. A white man who had lived over
six years among them was of material help, and several mythologic and
other texts were obtained with tolerable correctness through his aid.

On October 9 Mr. Gatschet left Fort Griffin and reached Fort Sill, in
the Indian Territory, on the 15th. Many Kaiowē and Comanche Indians
encamped during the warmer months of the year around this fort, which is
situated at the southeast base of the Wichita mountains. He engaged the
best help he could find for studying the Kaiowē language, for which
there is no Government interpreter. The Comanche is the predominating
language on the whole Kaiowē, Comanche, and Apache reservation, although
the Comanche exceed the Kaiowē but little in number. The Comanche is
more easily acquired, at least to the extent required in conversation,
and all the traders and shopkeepers on the reservation have a smattering
of it.

Better interpreters for Kaiowē were obtained at Anadarko, the seat of
the agency, where Mr. Gatschet remained from October 31 to December 12.
A few Kaiowē were found who had passed some months or years among
Americans or at the Indian schools at Carlisle, Chilocco, and elsewhere,
and could express themselves intelligibly in English. A few white
Mexicans were found among the Comanche, who were captured by them in
infancy, acquired the Comanche language, and have ever since lived among
these Indians. Of the Kaiowē, Mr. Gatschet acquired over two thousand
terms, phrases, and sentences, several historic texts of value, and of
the Comanche, eight hundred or a thousand words. The circumstances
necessitated careful and numerous revisions of everything obtained, by
which much of the time was absorbed.

The Na-ishi Apache, about four hundred in number and formerly roaming
with the Kaiowē, furnished also a large amount of terms, exceeding
fifteen hundred.

There are a few verbal similarities between the Kaiowē and the Shoshoni
languages, but apparently not enough to indicate anything more than long
association of these peoples. The Kaiowē has a dual in the intransitive
verb and in some nouns. There are more than a dozen different modes of
forming the plural of nouns. The subject pronoun is incorporated with
the verb as a prefix, and every tense has a different subject pronoun,
as in Otomi and other languages of southern Mexico.

Vocabularies were also obtained of Delaware, Ottawa, Yuchi, Caddo,
Wichita, and of the hitherto unstudied Caddo dialects of Anadarko and
Yatassi.

In spite of persevering search it was not possible to find any of the
Bidai or the Tonica in Texas, although it is probable that some of them
survived in that State as late as 1850.

Mr. Gatschet then passed a whole month among the Atakapa at Lake
Charles, the county seat of Calcasieu parish, Louisiana. Of the two
dialects traceable, only the western one seems to exist now, being still
spoken by a few women living at the town. The language is sonorous, but
strongly nasal.

Returning to the Indian Territory, after a fruitless search for the
Tonica and Adai, he stopped at Eufaula, Creek Nation, to meet a Na'htchi
Indian named Lasley, about sixty years old, who had represented his
tribe in the councils of the Creek Nation. This man explained his
Na'htchi terms and phrases by Creek equivalents, and these had to be
translated into English to obtain full light concerning the Na'htchi
terms. One legendary text was also obtained. The language is rather
consonantal and has a multiplicity of verbal forms.

Among the Yuchi tribe on Middle Arkansas river, southwestern bank, and
over 40 miles from Muscogee Station, Indian Territory, he remained but a
week, too short a time to obtain full information respecting this
interesting language. There are five or six hundred Yuchi still living
on this tract. Two texts and a few popular songs, with one thousand
terms of the language, were obtained.

The last stop was made among the Modoc at Quapaw Agency, at the agency
buildings. About ninety are left of those brought there for having taken
part in the Modoc war of 1872-'73. Five mythic tales were gathered from
the natives within the short time of three weeks, one of them being of
considerable length and of importance. It is called "The birth of
Aishish." The birth of this astral deity resembles in most particulars
that of Bacchus from the thigh of Jupiter after his mother, Semele, had
been burned to death. The terms, phrases, and sentences gathered,
besides the myth mentioned, amount to over fifteen hundred items, which
will prove useful for completing the work on the Klamath Indians of
Oregon now in preparation.

Of the Shawnee language several hundred words were gathered from the
Indians of that tribe settled around the agency.

Mr. Gatschet returned to Washington in April, 1885.


                      WORK OF REV. J. OWEN DORSEY.

Rev. J. Owen Dorsey visited the Siletz Agency, Oregon, in August, 1884,
to gain linguistic and other information respecting the tribes in that
region. When he returned, in November, he brought back as the result of
his work the following vocabularies:—Athapascan family: Applegate Creek,
Galice Creek, Chastā Costa, Miko-no-tunne, Chetco, Smith River, Cal.,
and Upper Coquille.—Yakonan family: Yaquina, Alsea, Siuslaw, and Lower
Umpqua.—Kusan family: Mulluk or Lower Coquille.—Takilman family: Takilma
or Upper Rogue River.—Shahaptian family: Klikitat.—Sastean family:
Shasti—total, nineteen vocabularies, ranging from fifty to three
thousand entries, exclusive of phrases and grammatical notes.

He also obtained materials for an account of the social organization
into villages of some of these Indians, the basis for which appears to
have been the clan or gens. Rough maps, showing the localities of the
villages, were made. Mr. Dorsey also obtained from several tribes the
corresponding Indian names of about sixty vegetal products, specimens of
which were brought to Washington for identification.


                      WORK OF MR. JEREMIAH CURTIN.

Mr. Curtin spent the first two weeks of July at the Quapaw agency,
Indian Territory, in making a collection of Modoc myths, which he had
begun in the preceding winter, being part of a general collection of
Indian myths begun in 1883. The number of Modoc myths obtained was
nearly one hundred.

After finishing work at the Quapaw Agency, he returned to Washington,
and shortly afterward was directed to proceed to northern California and
obtain vocabularies of the Nosa and Kombo languages, and thence to
Oregon to obtain vocabularies of the Wasco, Tyigh, and Tenina languages.

Work was begun on the Nosa language (Yanan family) at Redding, Cal., on
October 11. The difficulties were very great, especially at first, owing
to the fact that the Nosa are few in number, live far from one another,
and have a very imperfect knowledge of English.

The Nosa were a prominent and rather numerous people until 1864, when
all of them who could be found were massacred by white settlers, who
organized two companies for the purpose of exterminating the tribe.
Owing to a chance by which a few escaped and to the exertions of Mr.
Benjamin Oliver, who secreted several in his cellar, about fifteen full
blood Nosa survived.

Work on Nosa was continued in and around Redding until the end of
November, when Round Mountain was visited to complete the Nosa
vocabulary and obtain that of the Atsugei (Palaikan family), a very
interesting language. Work at Round Mountain was finished on January 8
and Redding was revisited on January 9, preparatory to departing for
Oregon.

Owing to the excessive severity of the winter and the snow blockades,
which lasted six weeks, communication with Warm Spring was closed, and
it was impossible to enter the reservation till January 27, when
Sinnashee, a school and center of the Warm Spring Indian population, was
reached.

At this place the Tyigh vocabulary (Shahaptian family) was collected.
The Wasco (Chinookan family) was obtained at the agency headquarters
near the Deschutes river. Tenina, being identical with the Tyigh
language, was omitted. From April 18, at which date work at the Warm
Spring agency was finished, until June 30, the time was devoted to
collecting myths in the Klamath reservation and at Yreka.

During the whole period of work all the myths that could be found among
the people whose languages were being investigated were reduced to
writing. In this manner a large body of Nosa, Atsugei, Tyigh, and Wasco
myths was collected. In the cases of Klamath and Shasti, myths were the
objects directly in view.

The vocabularies were obtained with satisfactory completeness and the
verbal systems worked out in detail.

The Nosa is remarkable for a regularity of structure which yields to
analysis and has a certain monotonous harmony of sound.

The Atsugei has a sonorous roll, a strong letter _r_, and a certain
number of words in common with the Shasti, itself one of the _r_
languages.


                          GENERAL FIELD WORK.


                    WORK OF DR. WASHINGTON MATTHEWS.

Dr. Washington Matthews, assistant surgeon U. S. Army, continued his
investigations among the Navajo Indians in New Mexico and Arizona. He
had been stationed in the Navajo country as post surgeon of Fort
Wingate, N. Mex., from 1880 to 1884, during which time he devoted
himself to studying the language, customs, and ceremonies of this tribe
as much as his official duties would permit. Some of the great
shamanistic ceremonies of the Navajo, occupying nine days for their
performance, he had often seen in part; but he had never had an
opportunity of witnessing one throughout its entire duration, as he had
not sufficient time at his disposal.

Before leaving New Mexico, however, he secured the friendship and
confidence of some of the leading medicine men and obtained their
promise to admit him to their most secret rites during their entire
performance whenever he should be able to avail himself of the
privilege. He was also promised complete instruction in the mythology
and symbolism of these rites.

In the autumn of 1884 he was given an opportunity, under the auspices of
the Bureau of Ethnology, to return to the Navajo country and devote
himself for a considerable time entirely to anthropologic studies among
the people.

He first visited the Navajo who dwell in the neighborhood of the San
Mateo mountains, the Tsotsildinè, or people of the Great Peak, a local
division or subtribe living much farther to the east and having longer
and more intimate associations with Mexicans and Americans than the main
body of the people. While at this place, he ascended the peak of San
Mateo, or Mount Taylor, a mountain held sacred by the Navajo, to observe
the various places on the mountain mentioned in the Navajo myths.

Leaving San Mateo he proceeded to Fort Wingate, and learning that one of
the most important of the Navajo rites was about to be celebrated at a
place called Niqotlizi (Hard Earth), north of Fort Wingate on the Navajo
reservation, he repaired thither without delay. The ceremony which he
went to witness was that of dsilyídje-qaçàl, or mountain chant. It is
also called Ilnasjingo-qaçàl, or chant in the dark circle of branches,
from the great corral of evergreens in which the public rites of the
last night are performed. It is known to the white men who live among
these Indians as the hoshkawn dance, from one of the public dances of
the last night, in which the Indian jugglers pretend to grow and develop
the hackàn, or _Yucca baccata_. This last night's performance is varied
and interesting and all persons, including whites and Indians of other
tribes, are permitted to witness it; but previously, for several days,
mystic rites are celebrated in the medicine lodge, to the most of which
only the initiated are admitted. Dr. Matthews remained ten days in the
Indian camp at Niqotlizi, during which time the shamans admitted him
into their medicine lodge and allowed him to observe their rites and
practices.

His most interesting discovery on this occasion was that of their system
of mythic dry paintings, by which they represent various legends or
traditions with dry pigments on the sanded floor of the medicine lodge.
A full account of the ceremonies and of the myth on which they are based
was prepared by Dr. Matthews and appeared in the Fifth Annual Report of
this Bureau.

When the ceremony at Niqotlizi was over he proceeded to a locality in
Arizona called by the whites The Haystacks, from the peculiar appearance
of the rock formations there. At The Haystacks another great ceremony,
probably the second in importance of the Navajo rites, was to take
place. Here he again encamped with the Indians and remained until the
work of the shamans was done.

The ceremonial observances witnessed on this occasion are, collectively,
called by the Navajo Klèdji-qaçàl, or chant of the night. They are
called by the whites the Yàybichy dance, from the name of the principal
masked character, Yèbitcai or Gebitcai, the granduncle of the gods. Like
the hoshkawn dance, it has several days of secret rites with elaborate
symbolic sand pictures and one night of public dances, less varied and
interesting than those of the hoshkawn. Dr. Matthews was permitted to
witness the whole performance and to take as many notes and sketches as
were necessary.

From The Haystacks Dr. Matthews went to the Indian agency at Fort
Defiance, Arizona, where he secured the services of one of the oldest
and most learned (in their own peculiar lore) of the Navajo priests, and
from him he obtained full explanations of all these rites and of the
symbolism of the pictures and masked characters, with a complete recital
of the long and elaborate myths on which the ceremonies depend, and the
texts and translations of the very numerous songs which form the ritual
of the ceremonies.


                       WORK OF DR. H. C. YARROW.

Dr. H. C. Yarrow, acting assistant surgeon U. S. Army, with the
assistance of military details and supplies, in addition to the
instruction and facilities provided by this Bureau, started, August 8,
1884, on an expedition into the Territory of Utah, with reference mainly
to the exploration of burial mounds and the study of mortuary customs.

Near Choke Cherry Spring a burial cave was discovered, containing the
skeletons of three persons, which were secured. Other skeletons, with
contents of graves, were obtained near Willow creek; also, an
interesting specimen of tree burial.

At Deep creek an explanation of the curious form of water burial was
gained from a chief of the Gosiats, to the effect that the bodies of the
turbulent and disorderly men of the tribe were thus disposed of to
prevent the spirits of these objectionable persons from joining the rest
of the tribe after death. Their bodies were sunk in springs and marshy
places and kept down by sticks and stones, so that their spirits could
never get out.

In the neighborhood of Fillmore a mound was excavated which afforded an
admirable example of the beforementioned conversion of a dwelling into a
sepulcher. The probability is that the deceased died in his house, which
was made of adobe bricks, and that it was at once abandoned and the body
left therein, the roof being first removed. The corpse was placed on the
floor and covered with a paste of moist clay, on which were placed the
mortuary gifts of weapons, utensils, and food. Cottonwood branches were
then piled above and set on fire, thus baking the clay crust and
charring the several objects. The whole structure had been covered, so
that on first examination the hard surface of burnt clay, 18 inches
below the loose earth, appeared to be the floor of a former dwelling.

In the whole of the expedition, which continued into the last days of
September, much difficulty was experienced from the suspicion and
consequent hostility of the Indians of the localities visited.


                       WORK OF DR. W. J. HOFFMAN.

Dr. W. J. Hoffman proceeded early in August to Victoria, B. C., where
numerous sketches of Haida totem posts and carvings were obtained, in
connection with the myths which they illustrated. At this locality
attention was paid to the burial customs and osteologic remains of the
nearly extinct tribe of Songish Indians.

At Port Townsend sketches were obtained of Thlinkit ivory and wood
carvings, clearly indicating the adoption by that tribe of Haida art
designs. Here, too, many Indians of British-American tribes were met on
their way south to work in the Puyallup hop fields, notable among which
was a large number of Haida, whose persons were examined for the purpose
of copying the numerous and varied tattoo designs with which they were
profusely decorated. Interpretations of many of these characters were
obtained from the persons bearing them, as well as from the chief artist
of the tribe, together with concise descriptions of the methods and
customs in connection with tattooing and the materials used. Drawings
were made of a collection of Eskimo pictographs and ivory carvings at
the museum of the Alaska Commercial Company and the California Academy
of Sciences, San Francisco, Cal.

At Santa Barbara, Cal., Dr. Hoffman discovered some painted pictographs
and examined a number which have not yet been published. In several
private collections at this place were found interesting relics of the
Indians formerly inhabiting Santa Cruz island, the most important of
which was a steatite cup containing earthy coloring matter and pricking
instruments of bone, which had evidently been used in tattooing. Painted
pictographs were also visited in the Azuza cañon, twenty-five miles
northeast of Los Angeles.

At Tule Indian Agency, in the deep valleys on the western slope of the
Sierra Nevada, sketches of pictographs were made in continuation of work
accomplished there two years before. Vocabularies were also obtained
from the Waitchumni Indians here located, as well as from the few
remaining Santa Barbara Indians at Cathedral Oaks, Santa Barbara county,
Cal. By far the greatest amount of pictographic material was collected
in Owen's valley, California, where series of petroglyphs are scattered
over an arid, sandy desert, the extremes of which are more than twenty
miles apart.




                              OFFICE WORK.


The work upon a synonymy of the Indian tribes of North America, which
has been mentioned to some extent in former reports, has been continued
with increased energy.

Every tribe of Indians of any size and importance has been treated of by
historians under a variety of names. The sources of these different
appellations are manifold. In very many instances the names of tribes or
other bodies of Indians communicated by themselves have been imperfectly
understood and erroneously recorded; misspelled names and typographical
errors have been perpetuated.

Traders, priests, and colonists have called the same tribes by different
names and the historian has often added to the confusion by handing down
these synonyms as the names of other and different tribes. Not a few
tribes well known under established names have received new names upon a
change of residence, especially when they have removed to a great
distance or have coalesced or allied with other tribes. Added to these
and to other sources of confusion are the loose and dissimilar
applications of the terms clan, band, tribe, confederacy, and league,
the same term having been used with various meanings by different
authors.

As a consequence the student of Indian languages and customs finds
himself in a tangle, as regards tribal names, which it is beyond the
power of the individual worker, unaided, to unravel. The scope of the
work in question includes the attempt to trace the several names back to
their sources and to ascertain their original and proper application, to
define their meaning when possible, and to relegate each tribe under its
proper title to the linguistic family to which it belongs. In the
completion of this work the whole force of the Bureau assists.

The need of a volume giving the results mentioned has long been felt,
and it is believed that it will prove to be one of the most important
contributions to the accurate study of Indian history ever made. The
classification of the languages of the North American Indians is closely
connected with the synonymy of tribal names, each work assisting the
other. During recent years the number of students who have directed
their attention more or less exclusively to the study of Indian
languages has been constantly augmented, and as a result of their labors
the number of vocabularies has been correspondingly increased; hence the
demand for a more comprehensive and satisfactory classification than now
exists.

Prior to Gallatin's time little or nothing had been done in the
direction of a systematic classification of Indian languages. In 1836
Gallatin issued his treatise in which he classified all the languages
which he was able to study by a direct comparison of vocabularies. His
classification was an immense advance over anything previously done and
has proved a boon for scholars, having served, indeed, practically as
the basis for most of the work in the same line performed since his
time. No fixed rules of nomenclature, however, have ever been adopted by
linguistic writers, and authors have named and renamed linguistic groups
without regard to the names imposed upon the same or similar groups by
earlier writers. As a result great confusion has followed not only
respecting the status of the various linguistic families, but also
respecting the identity of the languages which have served as a basis
for the several groups proposed. The remedy for this state of affairs is
the adoption, with strict adherence thereto, of a code of nomenclatural
rules similar in scope to those prevailing among zoölogists.

There would appear to be no good reason why the rule of priority of
name, for instance, should not be followed in linguistic as well as in
zoölogic classification, or why the same beneficial result of fixity of
nomenclature should not be expected to result from the adoption of this
rule in the one case as in the other. Students who may attempt to
unravel the many perplexing nomenclatural problems arising from
unnecessary change of names will certainly agree that such a rule is no
less desirable in linguistics than in zoölogy.

Accordingly, the rule of priority of name, within certain limitations,
together with some other rules, has been adopted by the Bureau. These
limitations and rules, together with a discussion of the subject, which
would still be premature, may be presented by the Director in his next
annual report.

Mr. H. W. HENSHAW, when not in the field, was specially engaged in the
organization and details of the office work upon tribal synonymy and
linguistic classification above described. A careful examination of all
the literature pertaining to these correlated subjects was necessary and
also the preparation of tentative tables of synonymy. He has prepared
such tables and made in connection with them a brief historical résumé
of the literature. Much longer time and the work of the whole official
force will, however, be needed for the completion for publication of the
results of this vast and complicated undertaking.

Mrs. ERMINNIE A. SMITH was occupied, while not engaged in the field as
reported above, in the revision for publication of her Tuscarora
dictionary, the material for which had been collected during several
years.

Col. GARRICK MALLERY continued the collection and classification of
material on the two correlated subjects of sign language and
pictographs. His two preliminary papers on those subjects have appeared
in former annual reports. It is intended, while increasing the data
obtained from the Indian tribes of North America, bearing upon these
subjects, to supplement and illustrate the mass of information collected
from those tribes by comparison with everything of a similar character
to be found in other parts of the world and to publish the results of
the collection and study in the form of monographs.

Dr. W. J. Hoffman, when not in the field, continued to assist in the
work mentioned.

Mr. JAMES C. PILLING'S preparation of the Bibliography of North American
Languages continued during the year. In October and November he visited
several libraries in Boston and Providence, for the purpose of clearing
up a number of doubtful points. During the year pages 839-1135 were
received from the printer, which completed the volume. In the spring a
limited number of copies were struck off by the Public Printer, and
these have been sent to various libraries, public institutions, and to
individuals interested in the subject, for the purpose of obtaining
additions and corrections, with the intention, if these should prove to
be numerous, of resetting the matter.

Mr. FRANK H. CUSHING was stationed at Washington at the commencement of
the fiscal year and was engaged in the classification of his field
material in preparation for its publication. During the fall he
completed a short paper on Zuñi culture growth as evidenced by studies
of Pueblo ceramics, which was published in the Fourth Annual Report of
the Bureau. In this paper he maintains, with a large amount of
linguistic evidence, that the Zuñi culture is mainly autochthonous, and
that its growth, especially the growth of architectural, agricultural,
ceramic, and other arts and industries pertaining to it, has been
largely accomplished within the desert areas of America which still form
the habitat of the Pueblo Indians, and probably, also, within a period
more limited than has usually been supposed essential to such
development.

He prepared also a paper on the "Ancient province of Cibola and the
seven lost cities," in which he not only identifies the seven cities of
Cibola above referred to with seven ruins near the present Zuñi village,
but also furnishes interesting examples of the permanence of Indian
tradition and of its value, when properly used, as a factor, in
ethnographic and historic research.

Among the later and perhaps more important results of his studies during
the year are investigations of the myths and folk tales abundantly
recorded by him during previous years among the Zuñi.

By the extended comparison which he is able to make between these folk
tales and myths, now first brought together as a whole, and by the
application to their study of the linguistic method employed by him in
the preparation of the two papers already mentioned, he is able to trace
the growth of mere ideas or of primitive conceptions of natural or
biotic phenomena and of physical or animal function into the personæ and
incidents which go to make up myths, as well as to trace the influence
of these growths on the worship of the Zuñi.

Early in 1885 Mr. Cushing furnished the Director with a schedule of his
manuscript, notes, and sketches, and from an examination of this it was
deemed advisable that he should continue putting his linguistic material
into permanent shape, in order that it might be used as a check on
ensuing studies of the sociology and mythology of the Zuñi, as well as
for its suggestive value towards the explanation of obscure passages in
those departments of study. This work had progressed but little,
however, when a severe illness necessitated its temporary abandonment.

Prof. CYRUS THOMAS, in addition to his administrative duties in charge
of the division of mound exploration, was engaged in preparing for
publication the results of the operations of that division. The constant
arrangement, comparison, and study of the material objects and facts
ascertained required his close application. He also commenced the paper
presented by him in this volume.

Mr. VICTOR MINDELEFF, in the first part of the fiscal year, completed
models of the seven villages of the ancient Province of Tusayan,
together with a relief model illustrating the topographical character of
the province. The model of Walpi, of this series, was carried out in
such a manner as to show on a large scale the character of the rocky
mesa on which the town is built. Several types of cliff ruins were also
modeled for this series, among them the White House ruin of Cañon de
Chelly and the mummy cave of Cañon de la Muerte. After August 1 this
work was carried on under the supervision of Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff, who
also prepared a model of the great Etowah mound from the data of Mr. V.
Mindeleff's survey; he also furnished several other examples of mounds,
with sections, under the direction of Prof. Cyrus Thomas. This work was
carried on without interruption until December 7, when Mr. Cosmos
Mindeleff was ordered to New Orleans, to take charge of the combined
exhibits of the U. S. Geological Survey and the Bureau of Ethnology, and
was instructed to look after the proper installation of the same in the
Government building. He returned to Washington about February 1. During
the ensuing four months the small force in the modeling room was engaged
in making models of the ancient pueblos of the Chaco, from the plans
secured during the preceding summer, as referred to in the report of
field work. This work continued until early June, when Mr. C. Mindeleff
was again ordered to New Orleans to take charge of the packing and
shipment of the exhibits of the Geological Survey and Bureau of
Ethnology for their return to Washington and for the installation of a
portion of the material at the Louisville Exposition. During the
interval from February 1 to June 15 Mr. Victor Mindeleff was engaged in
the preparation of a report on the architecture of the ancient provinces
of Cibola and Tusayan, together with the plans and diagrams necessary
for its illustration. This study was based on the large amount of data
that had been secured during former field seasons for modeling purposes.

Rev. J. OWEN DORSEY, when not in the field, made nearly 10,000 entries
for the Ȼegiha-English dictionary, and prepared Ponka and Omaha native
texts, with free and interlinear translations, in addition to those
found in part 1 of vol. 6, Contributions to North American Ethnology.
After December 1, 1884, he collated the following vocabularies obtained
by him in Oregon, viz: Takelma, Shasti, Applegate Creek, Chastā Costa,
Galice Creek, Mulluk, Siuslaw, Lower Umpqua, Yaquina, Klikitat, and one
on Smith River, California. He also prepared a list of the villages
obtained from the tribes at the Siletz Agency, Oregon.

Mr. ALBERT S. GATSCHET was engaged at the beginning of the fiscal year
in revising and perfecting his grammar of the Klamath language of
southern Oregon. The phonology was completed and stereotyped, extending
from page 200 to 245. He was engaged in correcting proofs of the
subsequent section on morphology when he proceeded to the Southwest, as
elsewhere reported, to investigate several languages spoken there, the
affinities of which had not before been ascertained.

Mr. W. H. HOLMES, as in previous years, has supervised the illustrations
of the Bureau publications. He also continued his archæologic studies,
chiefly in the department of ceramics, the character of which is shown
by his papers in this volume. He was in charge of the preparation of
exhibits for the expositions at New Orleans, Louisville, and Cincinnati;
but, owing to the pressure of other duties, much of this work was
intrusted to Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff, who was assisted materially by Mr.
Victor Mindeleff. The most important feature of the exhibits consisted
of models of plaster and papier mâché of the pueblo towns and cliff
houses of New Mexico and Arizona.

Aside from the models, exhibits of ethnologic and archæologic materials
were made. A large and important collection of objects of pueblo art was
obtained by Mr. James Stevenson, but much of it failed to reach
Washington in time for exhibition purposes, and a series of similar
objects, already classified and labeled, was selected from the National
Museum and forwarded to New Orleans. A valuable collection of the
ancient fictile products of Tusayan belonging to Mr. Thomas Keam was
also utilized in perfecting the exhibits of Pueblo art.

Archæologic materials from other sections of the country were placed on
exhibition, notably a superb collection of prehistoric relics from the
province of Chiriqui, Panama, which was purchased for the purpose.

The collections of ethnologic and archæologic material made during the
year are of unusual importance and magnitude. This is chiefly due to the
facilities afforded by the New Orleans Exposition fund, a liberal
portion of which was devoted to the collection and purchase of objects
of permanent value to the Government and to science. The collections
made by Mr. Stevenson in Zuñi and Acoma comprise upward of four thousand
pieces, chiefly objects of clay, but including other classes of
products. The collection of prehistoric relics obtained by Mr. J. A.
McNiel from the tombs of Chiriqui is one of the most important and
complete series of ancient American products to be found in any country,
and must prove of great value to students.

Mr. Victor Mindeleff secured a small series of relics from the ancient
ruins of northern New Mexico and Arizona, and Dr. H. C. Yarrow added
some objects of archæologic and ethnologic interest from central Utah.
Mrs. Erminnie A. Smith procured a number of articles of shell,
illustrating the modern manufacture of wampum in New Jersey; a small
collection of fragmentary pottery from the eastern shore of Maryland was
presented by Mr. Joseph D. McGuire, of Ellicott City; and Mr. Holmes
secured a series of articles, including arrowheads, shell implements,
and pottery, from the island of Nantucket. Mound explorations, conducted
by Dr. Cyrus Thomas, yielded a valuable series of objects of stone and
clay. An unusually interesting series of the earthen vessels of the
ancient pueblo races was secured by Mr. E. W. Nelson in eastern central
Arizona. The greater part of the abovementioned material has already
been catalogued and turned over to the U. S. National Museum.

Dr. H. C. YARROW, acting assistant surgeon, U. S. Army, besides his
field explorations described, continued to collect information relative
to the mortuary customs of North American Indians. Of the material
gathered, a considerable portion has been forwarded by various persons
throughout the country in answer to the circular sent out early in the
last year, but much has also been derived from the published works on
anthropologic subjects, including scientific journals and reports.
Numerous authorities have been consulted and much time has been devoted
to the consideration of the many theories advanced to account for
certain peculiar rites and customs.

Mr. CHARLES C. ROYCE continued during the year the preparation of a
historical atlas of Indian cessions. The boundaries of the various
cessions of land by the different Indian tribes were traced out and
located upon the maps of the States and Territories left uncompleted at
the date of the last annual report. All that remains to be done in
completing the atlas for publication is to transcribe, with considerable
elaboration, the historical and descriptive notes pertaining to the
various cessions, and to make, from the rough working sheets, legible
copies of the maps showing the boundaries of the cessions within the
States of California, Oregon, Nevada, and Texas and the Territories of
Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Utah, New Mexico, Arizona, and
Dakota. Most of these States and Territories will each require two maps,
showing respectively the primary and secondary cessions. The work will
be finished as rapidly as possible.




                          ACCOMPANYING PAPERS.


The present volume contains papers the subject matter of which may be
classified under the grand divisions of Technology, Philosophy,
Sociology, and Ethnography.

They are all prepared by experts of recognized authority in their
several lines of research and are illustrated to the degree required by
the text for full understanding, the number of figures presented being
548, besides ten full page plates. Special mention of each of these
papers follows in their order as printed.


         ANCIENT ART OF THE PROVINCE OF CHIRIQUI, COLOMBIA, BY
                           WILLIAM H. HOLMES.

The archæology of Chiriqui should be studied, not only for comparison
with that of the territory comprised in the present political divisions
of North America, but because geographically the province should be
considered as a part of the North American continent. Until recently
this isthmian region was little known, the explorations for railroads
and canals having furnished the first valuable accounts of its modern
inhabitants and the relics left by former occupants.

The National Museum now contains a large and precious collection of
archæologic material from the province, chiefly obtained by Mr. J. A.
McNiel during years of enthusiastic labor. The information derived and
the lessons to be learned from this collection, together with all
particulars relating thereto gathered from other sources, are now
presented in this paper by Mr. W. H. Holmes. His work in the
classification of the immense number of objects and in the elucidation
of their functions, material, construction, forms, and decorations has
been careful and comprehensive. His manifest success has been owing to
his artistic insight and skill as well as to his archæologic training.
His ability in both fields can be appreciated by an examination of the
287 illustrations in his paper, considered not only as to their number,
but as to their instructive arrangement in his text.

The objects of ancient art found in Chiriqui are, as elsewhere in North
America, derived almost entirely from graves. The cemeteries, apart from
their contents and the mode of sepulture, constitute in themselves
topics of interest which are discussed and illustrated in the paper.
Another curious feature is that the objects buried generally appear to
have been manufactured for mortuary purposes and not for use by the
living. A general review of the contents of the graves shows that the
ancient inhabitants were skillful in the manipulation of stone, gold,
copper, and clay, and tombs of undoubtedly great antiquity yield
evidence of long continued culture.

It also appears that, while the art of the old peoples of the isthmus
can in some respects be connected with that of adjacent regions in North
America, in others it is remarkable for individuality. Ornaments of
stone were seldom used by them and those of gold and copper were common.
The articles of gold which the graves have yielded in large quantities
to explorers during the last quarter of a century, and for which only
they have until recently been searched, have generally been considered
to be mere ornaments, but they probably had a fetichistic origin.

It is remarkable that no weapon, tool, or utensil of metal has been
noticed. The objects were generally formed by casting in molds, which
was done with considerable skill, and gilding, or at least plating, was
practiced. The art of alloying also appears to have been understood.

The use of metals does not appear early in the order of technology, and
an advanced degree of culture is generally attained before the casting
of any metal is attempted. Without allowing too much weight to any
argument based upon the surprising skill of these people in plating and
alloying, the evidence of technical skill in general, together with the
conceptions embodied in their art, proves conclusively that it was the
product of a long period of experiment and progress.

The pottery of Chiriqui is to be noted for the perfection of its
technique, its high specialization of form, and its conventional use of
a wide range of decorative motives. Its forms present many striking
analogies to the wheel made ware of the Mediterranean, regarded as
classic.

The mythologic stage of the builders of these graves is shown by the
fact that in their ceramic art there is no attempt to render the human
face or figure with accuracy. The personages of their religious
philosophy were zoömorphic and some of their forms may be discerned by a
skillful analyst in or on all the ornaments and vessels. On each of the
latter all decorative devices and delineations have some reference to
the mythic creature associated with the vessel and its functions.

Mr. Holmes has made an important discovery in the evolution of
decoration in Chiriqui from which are deduced instructive
generalizations of wide application. All the decorations originate
(doubtless under the influence of the stage reached in mythologic
philosophy) in life forms of animals, none being vegetal. Coming from
mythologic concepts they are significant and ideographic, and coming
from nature they are primarily imitative and non-geometric. Nevertheless
the agencies of modification inherent in the practice of art through its
mechanical conditions are such that the animal forms early employed have
changed into conventional decorative devices, among which are the
meander, scroll, fret, chevron, and guilloche.

That this was the course of evolution of the classic forms of ornaments
is not asserted; indeed, it is not necessary to form such a hypothesis,
as by the interacting principles, well classified by Mr. Holmes, the
course by which the same result was accomplished may have been wholly
diverse. It is, however, shown that this was in all probability the
particular and independent course in one region of America, being in
that respect in distinct contrast to other art regions, such as that of
the Pueblos, where the rise of geometric figures through technologic
channels is equally obvious. It follows that in seeking to divide
peoples by the criteria of their decorative arts the examination must
embrace what is far more fundamental than a mere comparison of their
finished products: these may be and are markedly similar without any
evidence of transmission, and when in fact by deeper study the
ascertained separate courses of development preclude such transmission.


           A STUDY OF THE TEXTILE ART IN ITS RELATION TO THE
           DEVELOPMENT OF FORM AND ORNAMENT, BY W. H. HOLMES.

For several years Mr. Holmes has been engaged in the study of the
ancient and existing art of the North American Indians, and has
published in the annual reports of this Bureau a number of elaborate
essays upon the art of specified peoples and regions.

In the present paper he submits the comprehensive results of his studies
in one great branch, the textile art, and treats chiefly of its esthetic
relations as distinct from those of construction and function, so far as
they can be separately discussed.

He has been fortunate in the character of the material studied. In
America there is yet found a great body of primitive, indigenous, and
independent art, almost uncontaminated by the complex phenomena,
processes, and conditions which elsewhere obscure its origin and
development. To a knowledge of American art acquired by long study Mr.
Holmes adds a mental equipment exceptionally qualifying him for its
philosophic discussion. His conclusions therefore, presented with ample
evidence and explained by illustrations, are to be received as those of
a recognized authority, although they may disturb some sentimental and
metaphysical fancies concerning abstract beauty in form, color, and
design.

It is not contended that the earliest concepts of beauty originated with
textile art. On the contrary, it is probable that the first esthetic
attempts were in the line of personal decoration, such as paints on the
skin and pendants and feathers disposed about the person. But as the
textile art appears early and widely in culture it is believed that the
association of esthetic concepts with it very generally preceded their
association with other arts. Having thus the start in the field, its
nature was full of suggestions of embellishment, while it was fixed in
its method of expression. The technique therefore shaped and directed
the esthetic concept and became the parent of much geometric ornament.

Mr. Holmes gives an instructive analysis of the forces and influences
inherent in the textile art, the first lessons of which are order,
uniformity, and symmetry; he shows how the necessities of technique
determine ideas of the beautiful in linear geometric forms and how taste
in selecting certain ornaments as the most beautiful is simply choosing
that product which in the evolution of art gave it character and power.

The influence of textile ornament upon other forms of art, such as
architecture and sculpture, is discussed, as also the manner in which
extrinsic decorative elements are remodeled in accordance with the rules
of textile combination. The paper, however, does not undertake to cover
the whole field of the development of form and ornament, being confined
to the relation of the textile art thereto, and similar studies in all
other grand divisions of art must be made before the relative importance
of all their forces and tendencies can be estimated. But the laws of
evolution in all art closely correspond, and the present paper is
eminently instructive to all students of the esthetic.


        AIDS TO THE STUDY OF THE MAYA CODICES, BY CYRUS THOMAS.

That Prof. Cyrus Thomas has long been engaged in the examination of the
few Maya records in existence is known from his former works, "A study
of the Manuscript Troano" and "Notes on certain Maya and Mexican
manuscripts," both published by the Bureau of Ethnology.

The object of the present paper is to give information of some original
discoveries and to present some explanations not brought forward by
Professor Thomas in his former papers.

The records of Maya and Mexico yet challenge students with unsolved
problems similar to those which in the writings of Egypt and Assyria
have perplexed so many generations. The translation of the paleographic
literature of this continent may be expected to throw light on the past
of America, in some degree reproducing the brilliant result which has
attended the translation of the hieroglyphs of the eastern hemisphere.
Long and laborious comparisons, together with the trial of successive
hypotheses, will be necessary to the decipherment of our aboriginal
manuscripts, and but few competent persons are actively engaged in the
work. It becomes, therefore, the duty of any one whose discoveries tend
to clear up even minor points of the great problem to furnish them to
his fellow laborers, and thereby limit the remaining field of
investigation. In this paper Professor Thomas supplements his former
work.


               OSAGE TRADITIONS, BY REV. J. OWEN DORSEY.

This paper contains an account of a secret society of seven degrees,
still existing among the Osage, in which the traditions of the people
have been preserved. The author, by his skill and personal influence,
has obtained and now furnishes two of these traditions in the original
language, with an interlinear and a free translation of each and with
explanatory remarks.

The traditions are both cosmologic and sociologic, and are admirable
examples of Indian philosophy. The existence of secret associations,
periodically celebrating religious mysteries, and of shamanistic orders,
which, by ceremonies, pictographs, and chants, have preserved in more or
less purity the traditions of their ancestors, has been vaguely known
for some years, but until lately no accurate or indeed intelligent
account of them has been secured.

The exertions of several of the officers of this Bureau have been
successful in obtaining full details and clear explanations both of the
traditions and the ceremonials of several of the Indian tribes, notably
those of the Zuñi and the Navajo, published in former annual reports.
The present paper by Mr. Dorsey takes an important place in this new
collection of materials for the study of Indian philosophy, from which
valuable results have been already acquired.


                 THE CENTRAL ESKIMO, BY DR. FRANZ BOAS.

For the express purpose of personal exploration and examination, the
author of this important paper spent a considerable time in the region
of which he treats. His course of travel was to Cumberland sound and
Davis strait. The grand division of the Eskimauan linguistic family,
inhabiting nearly the whole range of the Arctic-American coast, which
has been classed as Central Eskimo, occupies the northeastern part of
the continent and the eastern islands of the Arctic-American
archipelago. It inhabits, at Smith sound, the most northern countries in
which man has been known to dwell. Its southern and western boundaries
are about Fort Churchill, the middle part of Back river, and the coast
west of Adelaide peninsula.

Dr. Boas gives an admirable account of the topography of the region and
of the distribution, tribal divisions, and numbers of the inhabitants.
His work is replete with valuable statements in minute detail and with
acute suggestions regarding their habits and customs. Their peculiar and
ingenious weapons, implements, and utensils are fully described and
illustrated. His account of their religious practices and beliefs,
supplemented by translations of their myths and legends, is equally
entertaining and instructive.

In connection with his observations made through original research, Dr.
Boas presents the result of a close study and analysis of the work of
former explorers in this field, by which his contribution to the study
of this interesting hyperborean people will command additional
attention.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
